TODO:
For Veena:
Do quick general analysis of final linear model
p values
R-squared

Dataset Section:
size of dataset: need rows and columns.

part 1: for assumptions of linear regression, need to write quick sentence below the plots saying things look good and why


number plots, Figure 1, Figure 2 etc so we can refer to them

put summaries in appendix, number those so we can refer to them
summary(m_country)
summary(m_region)
summary(m_final)
confint(m_final)
numbered 1 through 4

check assumptions for ANOVA stuff???
add labels to all the graphs
add variables we created to data section
ask annie about skew in number of subjects taught
need to analyze direction/sign of coefficients

do we need sat_avg vs region plot if we have country map plot?

need help with p42 plot

for part 3 in question 2 —> should we do pairwise test?

What is this section for?:
# Collab and region LM
lmcolreg <- lm(sat_avg ~ region*as.numeric(collab), data=teacher_data)
# prep_A and region LM
lmpareg <- lm(sat_avg ~ region*as.numeric(prep_A), data=teacher_data)
# prep_B and region LM
lmpbreg <- lm(sat_avg ~ region*as.numeric(prep_B), data=teacher_data)
# prep_C and region LM
lmpcreg <- lm(sat_avg ~ region*as.numeric(prep_C), data=teacher_data)

for part 2, go back to 3 mosaic plots, prep A, B, C

Why do we have anova tests in two sections of part 2????

What does this sentence even mean?:
“We will then look at which variables from part (2) are significant when predicted with region. “

should we be doing things by region or country in part 2?
we could pick a subset of countries —> getting diversity in satisfaction level
pairwise t- test by region

we did group countries into regions and did analysis by region, but felt that geographical grouping didn’t capture all the factors and we could be missing trends 
take the most extreme satisfied and unsatisfied, look at factors there

conclusion - we don’t know how many teachers were sampled comparatively by country - we know it was no more than 22 per school, but were unable to analyze how representative our sample was of a country as a whole
in addition,  there were some country codes that were just cities - all our china teachers came from shanghai
